## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

Download the project on a code editor (Visual Studio Code), Ctrl+J, npm run dev and run localhost. 

There are still few minor imperfections of authentication but that does not restrict surfacing and navigating my whole application as a whole. 

Images will be provided on my porfolio as well, so not to worry. 

Use localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices and navigate from there onwards to see what I have done.
